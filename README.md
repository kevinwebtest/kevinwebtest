Hello, I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for all things related to computers, and a deep interest in finance. My technical expertise and analytical skills have been honed through my work experience in the tech industry.

I have gained valuable experience during my time working as a Software Engineer at Tokopedia (GoTo Group), where I was responsible for creating and fixing automation scripts. Additionally, I interned as a Software Development Engineer in Test at DANA Indonesia, where I was responsible for creating test analysis and test scripts and learned lots of SDET tools.

My ultimate goal is to continue pursuing a career in the tech industry, where I can apply my technical skills and contribute to the growth of the industry. I am always eager to learn and am excited about the new challenges and opportunities that come with a career in technology.
